The Optimized Binary Search Algorithm is given here. Here are the key optimizations:

Correct Midpoint Calculation: The calculation of the mid index using "start + (end - start) / 2" ensures that it avoids integer overflow and accurately calculates the middle index.
Updating Midpoint Within the Loop: The mid index is recalculated within the loop after updating the start or end pointers. This ensures that the search space is properly divided with each iteration.
Loop Termination Condition: The loop continues until start is less than or equal to end, ensuring that the search space is narrowed down correctly until the desired element is found or the search space is exhausted.

Overall, this implementation of binary search is optimized and should work efficiently for finding elements in a sorted array.

The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Here's why:

In each iteration of the binary search, the search space is halved. Initially, the entire array is considered as the search space. After the first iteration, at most half of the array remains to be searched. After the second iteration, at most one-fourth of the array remains, and so on.

This halving of the search space with each iteration gives rise to a logarithmic time complexity. Specifically, the number of iterations needed to reduce the search space to a single element (or determine that the element is not present) is logâ‚‚(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Hence, the time complexity of binary search is O(log n). This makes it significantly more efficient than linear search, especially for large arrays, as it can quickly narrow down the search space to find the desired element.
